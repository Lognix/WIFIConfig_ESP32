ESP32 Wi-Fi Configuration with Web Interface

  After uploading the firmware, the ESP32 will attempt to connect to a saved Wi-Fi network.
  If the connection fails, the LED on pin 13 will start blinking, and the ESP32 will start an access point.
  Connect to the CONFIGURATION access point and open the web page at 4.4.4.4.
  Enter the SSID and password of your Wi-Fi network.
  After saving the settings, the ESP32 will reboot and connect to the specified network.
